SameSameButDifferent is a digital project that generates virtual personal ID card based on the information that the ID's holder want to be represented, rather than the formal and restrictive information likes birth name, D.O.B, birth sex, nationality, religious, etc. on national/organization ID cards. The project aims to celebrate the freedom, diversity & complexity of one's identity, which pushes the boundaries of geography, goes beyond stereotypes, and reclaims one's right to appear with their preferred names, pronouns, opinions and things that matter to them, not to the authorities.
